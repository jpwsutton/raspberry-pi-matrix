Overview
--------
The 32x54 R&G LED matrix panels that this project is targeted against can be purchased from [Embedded Adventures][http://www.embeddedadventures.com/led_matrix_display_LDP-6432.html].

It is effectivly two 16x64 LED matrices in parallel, You address each 16 rows seperatly as will be descibed later.

The Datasheet for these displays can be seen here: [http://www.embeddedadventures.com/datasheets/LDP-6432.pdf], however I will do my best to explain the protocol here too.
